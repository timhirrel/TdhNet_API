The TdhNet Application Program Interface (API) allows programs created for or by third
parties to access much of the functionality incorporated into the TdhNet hydraulic network model. This
functionality is provided in the form of header files and executable libraries and is accessed through
various C++ classes and functions.

A Python interface has been developed within the TdhNet API which allows access to both the TdhNet and Epanet solution engines.

A simple demonstration program is provided as documented source code in the file
TdhNetAPI_Demo.zip within the compressed API file. The required header files are in the API file
Include directory.
