The TdhNet Application Program Interface (API) is intended to allow programs created for or by third
parties to access much of the functionality incorporated into the TdhNet hydraulic network model. This
functionality is provided in the form of header files and executable libraries and is accessed through
various C++ classes and functions.

A Python interface developed for the TdhNet (hydraulic network model) API.

A simple demonstration program is provided as documented source code in the file
TdhNetAPI_Demo.zip within the compressed API file. The required header files are in the API file
Include directory.
